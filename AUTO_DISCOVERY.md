# Auto-Discovery Feature Summary

The auto-discovery feature has been successfully implemented to automatically fetch allowed organizations and repositories for the authenticated GitHub account when no details are passed via arguments or configuration.

## What's New

### Automatic Organization Discovery
- When `--owner` is not specified, the application fetches:
  - User's personal GitHub account
  - All organizations the user belongs to
- Interactive selection when multiple options are available
- Automatic selection when only one option exists

### Automatic Repository Discovery  
- When `--repo` is not specified, the application fetches:
  - All repositories accessible to the selected owner
  - Filters repositories by the selected owner/organization
- Interactive selection with repository details:
  - Repository name and description
  - Visibility (Public/Private)
  - Default branch information

### Enhanced User Experience
- Clear prompts and numbered selection menus
- Helpful descriptions for each option
- Input validation with retry capability
- Graceful error handling and informative messages

## Usage Examples

### Basic Auto-Discovery
```bash
gh_cherry
```
This will trigger auto-discovery for both organizations and repositories.

### Partial Auto-Discovery
```bash
gh_cherry --owner myorg
```
This will use the specified owner but auto-discover repositories.

```bash
gh_cherry --repo myrepo
```
This will auto-discover organizations but use the specified repository.

### Configuration File Auto-Discovery
```toml
[github]
owner = ""  # Empty values trigger auto-discovery
repo = ""
```

## Technical Implementation

### New API Endpoints Used
- `/user/orgs` - List organizations for authenticated user
- `/user/repos` - List repositories for authenticated user  
- `/user` - Get authenticated user information

### New Functions Added
- `GitHubClient::list_user_organizations()` - Fetch user organizations
- `GitHubClient::list_user_repositories()` - Fetch user repositories
- `GitHubClient::get_authenticated_user()` - Get user information
- `select_organization()` - Interactive organization selection
- `select_repository()` - Interactive repository selection
- `Config::needs_auto_discovery()` - Check if auto-discovery is needed

### Configuration Changes
- Updated `Config::validate()` to allow empty owner/repo
- Added `Config::needs_auto_discovery()` method
- Enhanced CLI help text to mention auto-discovery

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: No need to remember or lookup organization/repository names
2. **Reduced Configuration**: Minimal setup required to get started
3. **Error Prevention**: Prevents typos in organization/repository names
4. **Discovery**: Helps users find repositories they have access to
5. **Flexibility**: Still supports explicit specification when needed

## Authentication Required

The auto-discovery feature requires GitHub authentication via:
- GitHub CLI (`gh auth login`)
- Personal Access Token in `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable

Without authentication, the application will show helpful error messages guiding users to set up authentication.
