# Project Plan: GitHub Cherry-Pick TUI Application

## Problem Statement
Create a Rust TUI application to assist with cherry-picking PRs to target branches (release branches typically). The application needs to:
- Use a TUI library (Ratatui) for terminal interface
- Use GitHub authentication for private/org repos 
- Integrate with existing GitHub CLI auth or support 2FA
- List PRs from develop branch with specific tags (S28 DEV pending cherrypick)
- Allow selection and cherry-picking of PR commits
- Update PR tags after successful cherry-pick
- Handle merge conflicts gracefully

## Research Phase
- [x] Fetch Ratatui documentation and understand latest API
- [x] Research GitHub API client libraries (Octocrab)
- [x] Research Git operations library (git2-rs)
- [ ] Research GitHub CLI integration for authentication
- [ ] Investigate tagging and PR manipulation via GitHub API
- [ ] Research conflict handling strategies

## Architecture Design
- [ ] Design main application structure
- [ ] Design state management for TUI
- [ ] Design GitHub API integration layer
- [ ] Design Git operations layer
- [ ] Design error handling strategy
- [ ] Design configuration management

## Implementation Phase

### 1. Project Setup
- [x] Update Cargo.toml with dependencies
- [x] Set up basic project structure
- [x] Create modules for different components

### 2. Core Dependencies Integration
- [x] Integrate Ratatui for TUI
- [x] Integrate Octocrab for GitHub API
- [x] Integrate git2-rs for Git operations
- [x] Set up tokio for async runtime

### 3. Authentication System
- [x] Implement GitHub CLI auth detection
- [x] Implement personal access token auth fallback
- [x] Implement 2FA support
- [x] Create auth configuration management

### 4. GitHub API Integration
- [x] Implement PR listing from develop branch
- [x] Implement tag filtering (S28 DEV pending cherrypick)
- [x] Implement PR details fetching
- [x] Implement tag updating functionality

### 5. Git Operations
- [x] Implement repository detection
- [x] Implement branch switching
- [x] Implement cherry-pick operations
- [x] Implement conflict detection and handling

### 6. TUI Implementation
- [x] Create main application layout
- [x] Implement PR listing view
- [x] Implement PR selection interface
- [x] Implement progress indicators
- [x] Implement conflict resolution interface
- [x] Implement status messages and error display

### 7. User Interaction Flow
- [x] Implement main menu navigation
- [x] Implement PR selection workflow
- [x] Implement cherry-pick confirmation
- [x] Implement conflict resolution workflow
- [x] Implement success/failure feedback

## Testing Phase
- [x] Unit tests for GitHub API integration
- [x] Unit tests for Git operations
- [x] Integration tests for full workflow
- [ ] Manual testing with real repositories
- [ ] Edge case testing (conflicts, network issues, auth failures)

## Documentation Phase
- [ ] Create comprehensive README.md
- [ ] Document installation instructions
- [ ] Document configuration setup
- [ ] Document usage examples
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide

## Validation Phase
- [ ] Code review and cleanup
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Final verification with test repositories
- [ ] User acceptance testing

## Progress Log

### [2025-08-07 Implementation] - Core Implementation Completed
- Successfully integrated all major dependencies (Ratatui, Octocrab, git2-rs)
- Implemented complete authentication system supporting GitHub CLI and PAT
- Built full GitHub API integration with PR listing, filtering, and label management
- Implemented comprehensive Git operations including cherry-picking and conflict handling
- Created complete TUI interface with navigation, progress indicators, and error handling
- Fixed all compilation issues and achieved successful build
- Application is now functional and ready for testing

## Notes and Observations

### Key Libraries Identified:
1. **Ratatui**: Latest version with modern API, supports widgets, layouts, and async operations
2. **Octocrab**: Modern GitHub API client with semantic API and HTTP API
3. **git2-rs**: Libgit2 bindings for Rust, handles Git operations
4. **Tokio**: Async runtime for handling GitHub API calls

### Authentication Strategy:
- Primary: GitHub CLI integration (gh auth status)
- Fallback: Personal Access Token
- Support for 2FA through GitHub's standard flows

### Core Workflow:
1. Authenticate with GitHub
2. List PRs from develop branch with specific tags
3. Allow user selection of PRs
4. Cherry-pick commits from selected PRs
5. Handle conflicts interactively
6. Update PR tags upon successful cherry-pick

### Technical Challenges Identified:
- TUI state management for async operations
- Conflict resolution in terminal interface
- GitHub API rate limiting
- Git repository state management
